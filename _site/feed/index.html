<p>In the last few weeks the The Superintendence for Archaeological
Heritage of Pompeii, Herculaneum and Stabia under the guidance of
the Institute of the Ministry of Heritage and Culture released 
<a href="http://open.pompeiisites.org/">http://open.pompeiisites.org/</a>
the first open datasets with the entire tenders and work status details
of the archeological sites.
After just few days from the Open Pompei debut we released the new
transparency and open data portal for the Expo 2015 now available 
on <a href="http://www.openexpo2015.it">http://www.openexpo2015.it</a> Open Expo
is the result of a massive effort coordinated by Giovanni Menduni from
the Milan Polytechnic who see us involved in a heterogeneous team with
members from Expo 2015 s.p.a., The Department of Statistic, Information
and Application (DiSIA) of the University of Florence, Formez PA and
Wikitalia who’s responsible and leading the entire initiative.
Giovanni in <a href="http://www.chefuturo.it/2014/09/il-primo-selfie-bob-dylan-e-il-senso-di-openexpo-per-unitalia-migliore/">his post</a>
already made a great summary of the OpenExpo backgrounds and the
spirit that animated the entire effort that bring it live in record time.</p>

<p>Meanwhile these two great italian initiaves are shedding a new lights
into the domain of large and complex public works is happening that a
multinational team is working to a new and dedicated standard to
facilitate similar initiative globally. 
I’m talinkg about <a href="http://www.open-contracting.org/">Open Contracting</a>
who have release just today a new beta versions of it’s
<a href="http://ocds.open-contracting.org/standard/r/0__3__3/">Open Contracting Data Standard (OCDS)</a></p>

<p>So as it’s happening in many other public sectors where opendata is becoming a default
it seems that also for organization involved in large public works, exposing
<em>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</em> is becoming a mandatory step, a unique opportunity
to engage with media and the public and estabilish a comunication channel
that otherways was not absolutelly immaginable.</p>

<p>Another interesting fact, is that similar initiatives could not be possible
without the involvment of public servants and civic hackers often grouped
into informal groups or under an NGOs. 
For the <em>Great Pompei Project</em> for example the
<a href="http://www.openpompei.it">Open Pompei accompanying project</a>
as been pivotal for animating the territory and the personnel in the field and
create the required awarness about the the <em>open</em> approach. 
In the case of Open Expo, Wikitalia and his president Riccardo Luna
have committed a plan to for openess of the Expo 2015 S.p.A. works 
<a href="http://luna.blogautore.repubblica.it/2014/07/09/open-expo-cose-cosa-comporta-e-perche-e-finalmente-ripartita-la-trasparenza-di-expo-2015/">during the Digital Venice event</a>
and engaged with several private and public organizations to setup
in record time the first release of the OpenExpo open data platform.</p>

<p>ok.. if you have not yet stopped reading this post, it means
that you are hungry so let me serve you few additional
details about what’s behind the scenes of Open Expo in the hope
that it will be usefull also for other dealing with similar challenges.</p>

<p>The aim of out team was to deliver a complete a meaningfull set of datasets
related to the Expo 2015 works and to make it available reusing as much as possible
the approach and infrastructure we already setup for the <a href="http://www.dati.gov.it">dati.gov.it</a> portal.
The objective so was 1st to make it in time before the September the 11th for the
<a href="http://www.expo2015.org/it/eventi/tutti-gli-eventi/la-conferenza-stampa-di-presentazione-openexpo">press conference</a>
that for te sake was just 12 days after our engagement and 2nd to create from scratch
a relational database schema to validate, consolidate and then expose the Expo 2015 works data.
The data indeed originally come from a shared spreadsheet feeded collaborativelly
and in record time by Expo’s personnel, periodically dumped into a MS Access and finally consolidated by us
into a relational PostgreSQL schema. It was a continuos iterative process that went far beyond the most extreme programming
practices. We also had to adapt the layout and perfomr a little customization to few features of the underlying CKAN.
if you are interested the Expo2015 CKAN plugin has been released as open source and <a href="https://github.com/sciamlab/ckanext-expo2015">made available on GitHub</a>
It was like a mission impossibile, a sleepless experience but definitivelly funny and more importantly finally as a team we all won
as we was able to make it going live the day before the planned date</p>

<p>In everyone’s life, experiences mediated by software occupy
an increasingly large portion of our day and basically that
is likely to increase over time. Despite it happen constantly
before our eyes - every time we use the phone to call home, 
the office computer, reading the newspaper on the tablet or
taking directions from the navigator in the car - we do not
realize that willy-nilly we leave a trace of ourselves and of
our actions in any internediate system that records.</p>

<p>The production of personal data that concern us and that we
allow or maybe want share is ‘already started’ since
several years, but the amount, the frequency and spread
only recently assumed a trend that follows Moore’s law so it’s going
to increase exponentially over time. Google Glass is slowly approaching
into the lives of many of us. It’s now time for a second and then a thrird
wave after smartphones and smartwatches of personal tools that make
our experience mediated by the software more and more “integrated
with every moment of our livesi”.</p>

<p>Far from being a criticism, this is to be a realization that our habits,
our interests, and much more of the personal sphere is ‘destined to become
heritage of many other entities’ wholly alien to us. It ‘s not
only the concept of privacy connotations that are taking more
and more’ subtle but they are what we consider the basic elements
of our conception of society’.</p>

<p>A lucid and fascinating reflection on these issues is contained 
in the book <a href="http://www.jaronlanier.com/futurewebresources.html">Who Owns the Future</a>
by Jaron Lanier that’s the creator of 
concepts such as virtual-reality and’ back in their footsteps and even 
staying in the role of Silicon Boys, peers with a sharp criticism of 
the radical changes that the technology and software in particular 
have led to humanity.</p>

<p>We are wondering about these issues and we teased the idea of 
​​talking about it here to open our blog. In these columns, we want 
to share what happens behind the scenes of opendatahub.it and the
discussions that animate our days while we reason how to make easier 
and more effective access to the open data available in Italy.</p>

<p>see you soon,
SciamLab Team</p>
