The data in the possession of public authorities may be used (re-used) by natural or legal persons for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, or other institutional purpose than for which the data was originally produced.

The European directives have established the regulatory framework for **the re-use of public data**, which recognize in the information held by the public sector and its reuse opportunity for development and growth for the entire European Union.

**SciamLab** is responsible of the entire CKAN-based Open Data catalog and interoperability platform of **the Open Data Portal of the Lazio Region** (Italy).

**Dati.lazio.it** is the website of the Lazio Region dedicated to Open Data and the regional administration of all government departments of the territory. The site has **four objectives**: to increase the value of public information; raise awareness of all citizens on issues related to Open Data and Open Government; stimulate the involvement and **active participation of citizens** and stakeholders in the project for region opening data; and create opportunities for growth and territorial development by directing the information public to commercial purposes.

For this, the website is addressed to citizens, public operators, businesses, researchers and journalists on the regional and national level.

How it works? From the homepage of the website you can access to **the 20 categories in which the dataset are organized**. It depends on the kind of the departments or regional structures as for example health care, budget, taxation, payments, agriculture, environment or heritage.

How can you search for data? The website is collected and published through the catalog data (CKAN). To explore you can search: by keyword, for topics, on a map of Lazio region, for formats (csv, xml, rdf, etc.), by type of data (alphanumeric, geographical, documents, etc.) or by type of license.

Dati.lazio.it is **a big step** to improve the accessibility to public information in this territory.
